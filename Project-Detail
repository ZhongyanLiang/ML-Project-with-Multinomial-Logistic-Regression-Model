## Research Question---Purpose & Interest
We are interested in analyzing the white_wine dataset for predicting the level of wine quality score. The independent variables, in this case, are quantitative, including residual sugar, alcohol, and density, etc.   This dataset was created by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. in their article “Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties”. 
## Initial Model
Wine Quality is an ordered factor response variable, using Ordinal Multinomial Model is first preliminary choice.
